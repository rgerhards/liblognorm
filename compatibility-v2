  * ln_loadSamples() --> ln_loadRulebase()
- loading of sample at runtime is no longer possible. This is due to
  the fact that the parse DAG is compiled into the most efficient form
  and thereafter read-only. If urgently needed, we could change the code
  so that the unoptimized form is kept (memory intense) and a re-compile
  happens after each addition (time intense).
